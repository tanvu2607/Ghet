# Add any project-specific ProGuard rules here.

# Flutter applications typically do not require custom ProGuard rules
# unless they use specific native features or third-party libraries
# that rely on reflection or dynamic code generation. The default
# 'proguard-android-optimize.txt' usually handles most cases.
